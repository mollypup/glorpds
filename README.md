# glorpds [WIP]
A *not so* from-scratch (but rather glorpy!) atproto PDS implementation that dreams of becoming spamware. 

glorpds is a fork of david's millipds, which is less glorpy

glorpds is intended to be a scrunkly pile of junk that offers more flexibility for scripting than millipds. the purpose is to provide an easy to use api for spinning up pds' and accounts, going for good enough and generic 

differences from millipds: 
- more functions 
- s/millipds/glorpds/g

roadmap: 
- programatic account creation
    - some function of the sort of "create_plc_account(handle, password)" that handles the account creation for plc in a sloppy but best effort sort of way
- nothing else yet
